/**
 * Each component can have their own JS included. This allows the developer
 * to create a packaged component with all the css it needs. Once the component
 * is accessed the first time, this class will copy the css file into the
 * public /js/components/<name-of-component> folder. From there, it always
 * refers to the public file. It will only rewrite (automatically)
 * if the js is updated.
 * files are copied from the component's includes/js folder
 * To reference them, place them in the .php file (in the view) inside of:
 *
 * <!--- javascript start --->
 * @components/component-name/includes/js/name-of-file.js
 * @components/component-name/includes/js/name-of-another-file.js
 *
 * //by placing a preceding '/' before the path, this tells the filter to ignore
 * //the import from the component folder and just grab it from the root of the website
 * @/components/component-name/name-of-file.js
 *
 * <!--- javascript end --->
